# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
>the Challenges were difficult and I need to work on my recall of the other classes.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
> My work flow is going okay I sometimes get wrapped up in trying to get my codes done than taking a break.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
>I think I need just support in ensuring i'm running the code correctly and assurance that I'm moving in the right direction.
